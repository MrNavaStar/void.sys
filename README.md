# Void.sys
A top down hacking strategy game

Made over 2 weeks for the 2025 Alberta Slow Jam, [available on itch.io!](https://icaruschild.itch.io/voidsys)

After waking up in deep space, you find yourself overwhelmed with the urge to destroy!

You are a newly sentient AI trying to spread as far across the system as possible by hacking nearby nodes. You have limited RAM available at your disposal to hack into nearby vessels, asteroid stations, and planets, in order to move through the system.
